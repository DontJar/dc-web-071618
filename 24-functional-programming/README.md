## Higher Order Functions and Functional Programming

### Take another function as a parameter
 - Callbacks
   - Array methods
   - setTimeout

### Return a Function
 - Function Factories

### Nested Functions
 - Closures

### Run once and only once
- IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)

## Functional Programming (vs. Object Oriented Programming)
 - Pure Functions
 - Does not mutate state, affecting global variables or other parts of the program
 - Declarative code
 - Each function does one thing




## Functional Programming Lab: starts now after lecture

## Next topic is DOM, gives us something more tangible to work with
- Note: ignore any mention of OOJS
- Note: There is a Lab called DOM Challenge that is listed as reading but is a Lab
- Note: Konami Lab test cases don't work...
