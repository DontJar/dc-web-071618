# Rails API
- For Mod 3 Project
- Dynamic web pages with JS front end and Rails backend
- Single page application

### Why? Rails
- Server: instead of serving a web page, serves data (json)
- Manage large database (update/add rows)
- Use relationship between models

### Getting Started
`rails new --api <project_name>`

### Useful Rails Commands for set up
- `rails g model cat`
- `rake db:migrate rake db:seed`
- `rails g controller cats`

### Make sure we do
- migrate and have seed data
- set up routes

### Serializer
- Transforming raw data into a string
- [Active Model Serializer](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers)
- `rails g serializer cat`

### CRUD

### CORS
- Cross Origin Resource Sharing


### Rails Lab: Ignore the part about
- `Last time out we created a PostSerializer and used it to serialize a Post to JSON.`
- [This mistake](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/using-to-json-ruby)

### Transition to Project Mode
- Make two repos, one for backend and one for front end
- Build out back-end skate board first, then front end skateboard
